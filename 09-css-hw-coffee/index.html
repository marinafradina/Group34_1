                <p class="px-1 flex-grow-1">Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
                    accounts for the rem aining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main
                    coffee-growing
                    cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
                    produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state
                    of
                    Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>

                    Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
                    bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is

                <p class="px-1 flex-grow-1">Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed
                    as
                    Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor
                    characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known
                    species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica
                    in
                    India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>
